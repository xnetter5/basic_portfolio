            <p>My name is Alexander Netter but I go by Xan. Xan is the middle part of Alexander. My mother named me Alexander but actually has disliked the name since birth.</p>
            <p>I have lived in LA, SF and NYC in my life. I have a passion for film, photography, art, running, watching sports and trying new restaraunts.</p>
            <p>I am learning coding because I think it is important tool to know. I also am very passionate about technical things and would love to have a greater understanding of how they work.</p>
